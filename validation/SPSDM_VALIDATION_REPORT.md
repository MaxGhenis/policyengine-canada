# PolicyEngine Canada vs SPSD/M Validation Report

## Executive Summary

This report validates PolicyEngine Canada calculations against Statistics Canada's Social Policy Simulation Database and Model (SPSD/M) Version 29.0. The validation focuses on key federal benefit programs including Old Age Security (OAS), Canada Child Benefit (CCB), and GST/HST Credit.

**Overall Result**: OAS calculations show **100% accuracy** against SPSD/M. CCB and GST calculations show discrepancies that need investigation.

## Test Results

### ✅ Old Age Security (OAS) - FULLY VALIDATED

All 8 OAS test cases passed validation against SPSD/M expected values:

| Test Case | Description | Result |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Basic OAS with no clawback ($30k income) | ✅ PASS |
| 2 | Partial clawback at $100k income | ✅ PASS |
| 3 | Senior over 75 with 10% boost | ✅ PASS |
| 4 | Full clawback at $150k income | ✅ PASS |
| 5 | Partial residency (50% benefit) | ✅ PASS |
| 6 | Income at exact threshold ($90,997) | ✅ PASS |
| 7 | Age 75 at threshold with boost | ✅ PASS |
| 8 | Minimal repayment ($1k above threshold) | ✅ PASS |

**Key Validated Components:**
- ✅ OAS base amount: $8,628 (2024)
- ✅ Repayment threshold: $90,997 (2024)
- ✅ Repayment rate: 15%
- ✅ Older senior boost: 10% at age 75
- ✅ Residency calculation: years/40
- ✅ Repayment capping at benefit amount

**SPSD/M Variable Mapping:**
- `oas_pre_repayment` → SPSD/M `imoasmax`
- `oas_repayment` → SPSD/M recovery tax
- `oas_net` → SPSD/M `imioas`

### ⚠️ Canada Child Benefit (CCB) - NEEDS REVIEW

CCB tests show significant discrepancies:

| Test Case | PolicyEngine | Expected | Difference | Status |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Low income family | $6,450 | $15,054 | -$8,604 | ❌ FAIL |
| Middle income partial | $147 | $1,152 | -$1,005 | ❌ FAIL |
| High income phase-out | $0 | $0 | $0 | ✅ PASS |
| Single parent 3 children | $6,133 | $17,366 | -$11,233 | ❌ FAIL |

**Issues Identified:**
1. Base amounts appear to be using 2022 values instead of 2024
2. The calculation seems to be missing full annual amounts
3. Phase-out calculations may have incorrect rates

**Required Actions:**
- Update CCB parameters to 2024 values
- Verify annual vs monthly calculation
- Review phase-out rate implementation

### ⚠️ GST/HST Credit - NEEDS REVIEW

GST Credit tests show systematic underestimation:

| Test Case | PolicyEngine | Expected | Difference | Status |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Single person low income | $467 | $519 | -$52 | ❌ FAIL |
| Married couple | $467 | $1,038 | -$571 | ❌ FAIL |
| Family with 2 children | $789 | $1,586 | -$797 | ❌ FAIL |
| High income phase-out | $628 | $0 | +$628 | ❌ FAIL |
| Single parent | $628 | $1,312 | -$684 | ❌ FAIL |

**Issues Identified:**
1. GST credit amounts appear outdated
2. Phase-out calculations not working correctly
3. Family composition adjustments may be incorrect

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **OAS**: No action needed - fully validated ✅
2. **CCB**: Update parameters to 2024 values from official sources
3. **GST**: Update credit amounts and phase-out thresholds for 2024

### Future Improvements
1. Implement automated SPSD/M comparison tests in CI/CD pipeline
2. Add more comprehensive test cases for provincial benefits
3. Create parameter update schedule aligned with government announcements
4. Implement OAS Allowance income testing (currently simplified)

## Technical Notes

### Test Methodology
- Created standardized test cases based on SPSD/M documentation
- Used PolicyEngine Canada's test framework for validation
- Compared outputs with expected SPSD/M values using 1% tolerance for OAS
- All tests run against 2024 tax year parameters

### Known Limitations
1. OAS Allowance implementation is simplified (no income testing)
2. Some parameters may be using older values pending official updates
3. Provincial variations not fully tested

### Data Sources
- SPSD/M Version 29.0 Parameter Guide
- Government of Canada official benefit calculators
- CRA published rates and thresholds for 2024

## Conclusion

PolicyEngine Canada demonstrates **excellent accuracy for OAS calculations**, achieving 100% validation against SPSD/M. The CCB and GST credit calculations require parameter updates to achieve full parity. Once these updates are implemented, PolicyEngine Canada will provide SPSD/M-equivalent calculations for core federal benefits.
