# PolicyEngine Rules PR Reviewer Subagent

## Overview
This subagent specializes in reviewing PolicyEngine pull requests that implement or modify tax and benefit rules. It ensures accuracy against source documents, validates calculations, and checks for completeness.

## Installation
To make this subagent available across all your PolicyEngine repositories:

1. Copy the `.claude/subagents` folder to your home directory or a shared location
2. Set the environment variable: `export CLAUDE_SUBAGENTS_PATH=~/.claude/subagents`
3. The subagent will be automatically available in all Claude sessions

## Usage

The subagent activates automatically when you:
- Ask to "review a PolicyEngine PR"
- Request to "validate parameters against sources"
- Say "check if this calculation is correct"
- Work with files in `parameters/`, `variables/`, or `tests/` directories

### Example Commands

```

"Validate the GIS parameters against official government sources"
"Check if the Climate Action Incentive calculation matches the legislation"
"Verify all test cases in this PR by hand calculation"
```

- Shows step-by-step work
- Identifies gaps in test coverage
- Suggests additional test scenarios

#### 5. Documentation

## Output Format

The subagent provides a structured review with:

### ‚úÖ Verified Against Sources
Lists all parameters/rules that match official documentation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Discrepancies Found  
Highlights any differences between PR and source documents

### üîç Missing Components
Identifies policy aspects not implemented

### üìä Test Case Verification
Shows hand calculations for each test with pass/fail status

### üìù Documentation Issues
Lists missing or unclear documentation

### üí° Recommendations
Provides actionable suggestions for improvement

### Confidence Level
Rates review confidence (High/Medium/Low) with explanation

## Example Review

```markdown
## PR Review: Implement EI and CPP payroll taxes

### ‚úÖ Verified Against Sources
- EI rate 2024 (0.0166): Matches CRA source
- CPP maximum 2024 ($71,300): Matches official rates
- Basic exemption ($3,500): Correct per legislation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Discrepancies Found
- CPP2 rate: PR has 0.04, but source shows 0.0400 (formatting)

### üîç Missing Components
- Not implemented: Quebec separate QPP system
- Missing: EI fishing benefits special rules

### üìä Test Case Verification
#### Test: Employee with $50,000 income
**Hand Calculation:**
- Step 1: Pensionable = $50,000 - $3,500 = $46,500
- Step 2: CPP = $46,500 √ó 0.0595 = $2,766.75
- Result: $2,766.75
- Test expects: $2,766.75
- Status: ‚úÖ Match

### üìù Documentation Issues
- Missing: Explanation of basic exemption application
- Unclear: How mixed employment/self-employment handled

### üí° Recommendations
1. Add Quebec QPP as separate parameter tree
2. Include tests for maximum contribution scenarios
3. Document the exemption allocation methodology

### Confidence Level: High
Based on direct verification against CRA T4127 document
```
